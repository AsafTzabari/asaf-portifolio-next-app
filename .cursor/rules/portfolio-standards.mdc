# Portfolio Website Standards

## SEO & Metadata
- Every route (`page.tsx` / `layout.tsx`) must have meaningful `metadata` (title + description).
- Use descriptive, human-readable titles (include your name/role when relevant).
- Add Open Graph and Twitter metadata for share previews when applicable.
- Prefer `generateMetadata` when content is dynamic.
- Use one `h1` per page and keep heading hierarchy valid (`h1` → `h2` → `h3`).

## Accessibility
- Prefer semantic HTML (`main`, `header`, `nav`, `section`, `article`, `footer`).
- All interactive elements must be keyboard reachable and have visible focus styles.
- Provide accessible names for icon-only buttons/links (`aria-label` when needed).
- Ensure color contrast works in light and dark mode.
- Images must have meaningful `alt` text (decorative images should use empty alt: `alt=""`).

## Performance
- Use `next/image` for images and always provide `alt`.
- Avoid layout shift: set image sizes/aspect ratio and avoid late-loading critical layout elements.
- Keep client components small; do not add `"use client"` unless required.
- Prefer Server Components for content and data fetching.

## Content Structure
- Use a consistent section layout (hero, projects, skills, about, contact).
- Keep copy concise and outcome-focused (impact, tools used, links to demo/source).
- External links should open safely: `target="_blank"` with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

## Contact / Forms (if added)
- Prefer Server Actions or API routes for submissions.
- Validate and sanitize input on the server.
- Never expose secrets in the client; use environment variables server-side only.
